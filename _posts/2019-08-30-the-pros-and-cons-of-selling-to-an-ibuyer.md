Given the recent popularity of instant offer companies, otherwise known as “iBuyers,” many sellers have asked me whether selling to such a company is a good idea. Actually, there’s no-one-size-fits all answer. Instead, consider these pros and cons.

**Pro No. 1: You get to choose your closing date.** This can be very handy for people on a strict schedule, such as those who are relocating for a job.&nbsp;

**Pro No. 2: There is no appraisal or financing contingencies.&nbsp;**

**Pro No. 3: There is no showings.** In other words, you get to sell your home as is without worrying about strangers walking through it and assessing every detail.&nbsp;

**Con No. 1: You will probably lose money.** The convenience of an iBuyer sale may be nice, but the high fees and low offer price will almost certainly leave you earning thousands of dollars less than you could have on the open market.

**Con No. 2: There will be surprise fees.** While iBuyers don’t require an appraisal, they do require an inspection. And once this inspection is finished, they will knock money off of their offer price to compensate for any problems they’ve found.&nbsp;

The best course of action in determining whether selling an iBuyer is right for you is to speak with your Realtor. They will help give you an idea of what you’d likely earn by selling to an iBuyer as it compares to what you could earn on the open market.
