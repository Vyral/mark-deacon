What a difference a few months make. Just this spring, we seemed to be entering a buyer’s market. Demand was receding, home price growth was slowing, and more and more homes were being listed for sale.

**But this is not true today.**

Home prices are heating up again. **The average price of homes sold this May rose 3.6% from a year earlier**—the biggest gain in seven months. Demand is up, too, with **more buyers showing up for viewings.**

So what changed?

It’s simple: **Mortgage rates have dropped steadily since April, and are currently at the lowest levels in a year and a half.** In fact, the 30-year fixed mortgage rate is just 0.5% higher from the all-time low they reached in 2012.

This has improved affordability, gotten more buyers interested in making a move, and caused the market to heat up once more.

All of this is good news if you're looking to sell.

Right now, demand outstrips supply so much that **if you were to put your home up for sale, you could still sell quickly and for top dollar.&nbsp;**

Mortgage rates are likely to start trending up once again in the coming months. The Mortgage Bankers Association predicted an increase up to 4.4% through the rest of the year. For reference, that’s the same rate we saw a few months ago when it seemed we were entering a buyer’s market.&nbsp;

That's why now is such a golden moment in case you're considering selling. If you want to get the process started or if you have any real estate-related questions for me at all, don’t hesitate to give me a call or send me an email. I look forward to hearing from you soon.
