Today I’ll answer two questions geared toward a special segment of homebuyers: **What are VA loans? And can you use them more than once?&nbsp;**

To answer the former, the VA loan is an incredible program designed to help active-duty military members and veterans with affordable homeownership. Using a VA loan, **buyers have the exceptional opportunity to purchase a home for zero money down and can even qualify with a credit score as low as 580.** This under-utilized program grants you the opportunity to not only buy a home, but also to build wealth.&nbsp;

As for the second question, **provided you meet certain criteria, you can actually purchase multiple homes through VA loans.** There are a few different reasons a buyer might pursue this option. Chief among them is direct relocation. If you’ve been assigned to a PCS or are moving to another geographical location, you’ll likely be able to buy a second home and keep your first as a rental property.

You might also be eligible to purchase a second home upon relocation **if you’ve had a change in family size or in employment location.** If none of these apply, you can always refinance your current home, thereby freeing up your eligibility to buy another home by way of a VA loan.&nbsp;

Just a few years ago, a client of ours bought a home in Avondale. After their purchase, they had two more children and needed to upsize. It all worked out in the end: We helped them find a renter for their Avondale property and they moved into a larger home in Buckeye—for zero down at that. They now own not one, but two homes, and their Avondale home is a means of income. &nbsp;&nbsp;
