*If you’re planning to put your home on the market this fall, follow these key listing tips to boost your success.*

When selling a home in the fall, there are a few key steps you should take.&nbsp;

The first step is one that applies all year long: **Research current market trends.** This means partnering with a professional agent to determine how many competing homes are available and what homes in your neighborhood are selling for, among other things. Above all, understanding what kind of market your area is experiencing is key.&nbsp;

Generally, markets will either be categorized as a buyer’s market, a seller’s market, or a balanced market. A seller’s market is one in which sellers have the upper hand and is usually categorized by a lack of available listings and a strong level of buyer demand. It’s definitely possible to succeed in any type of market, but knowing what kind of conditions you’re facing will help to inform your listing strategy.&nbsp;

Of course, this is only part of the equation. **Another way to boost your fall selling success is by embracing the spirit of the season and decorating accordingly.** Adding a few seasonal touches to your listing’s decor can make potential buyers feel much more at home. Don’t go overboard by any means, but do add festive throw pillows and other tasteful touches. Even lighting a pumpkin pie-scented candle before a showing can have a big impact.&nbsp;

And don’t forget your home’s exterior. **Decorating the inside will only go so far if your home’s curb appeal is lacking**, so be sure to clean up your yard and front porch, as well. This means raking any fallen leaves, trimming back trees or bushes, clearing walkways, and adding fresh mulch. Putting a pot of mums out is also a nice touch.&nbsp;

Preparing your home inside and out for showings will be essential to your success. Along with the tips we mentioned earlier, always declutter, clean, and stage your home before letting buyers inside. Also, don’t be afraid to appeal to senses beyond just sight. **Lighting a pumpkin pie-scented candle, for example, can make your home feel all the more inviting.** Baking cakes or pies before a showing will have a similar effect.&nbsp;

Finally, make sure all of your home’s lights are on before a showing. Daylight hours are limited at this later time of year, so keeping your home bright and well lit is a must.&nbsp;
